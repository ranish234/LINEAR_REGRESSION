# LINEAR_REGRESSION
The main points of linear regression include its objective to understand variable relationships and predict outcomes, using a dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent variables (X). The relationship is represented by a linear equation like \(Y=a+bX\). The method aims to find a "best fit" line, often using the least squares method.
